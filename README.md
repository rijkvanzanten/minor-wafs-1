## Looking back
This week was quite frustrating for me, I had never worked with an API and honestly didn't know where to start. I started searching for examples but soon found there weren't many. At last I found a course about xhr on Codecademy which gave me a place to start and a better understanding of the assignment. I didn't get it the first time so I tried the microLib aja.js. That actually helped me to later on finish the vanilla xhr as well. :)

I've also used handlebars.js and routie, I think it's great I know how to use them now, but I wouldn't use them again in such a small application. Handlebars I found very hard to implement, because I didn't understand most of the documentation about block helpers. 

I've learned a lot this week, but I really wouldn't have been able to do it alone. I do get a better understanding of where to look when I get an error or when something is just not working, so thats really positive.
