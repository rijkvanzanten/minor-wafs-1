#Assignments for week 2 of the minor Webdevelopment

In **'opdracht-1'** you'll find two versions of a script, one with the microlib aja.js (opdracht-1/static/script2.js) and one which uses xmlHttpRequest (opdracht-1/static/script.js). I've also commented extensively on the vanilla version, it really helped me to understand XHR better by trying both methods. I've also followed a course on Codecademy about APIs which was quite useful because it gave me an indication of where to start.
